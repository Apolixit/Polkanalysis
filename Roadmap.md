# Roadmap

Substats is an easy to use Substrate ecosystem explorer.  
I have for goal to increase its functionnalities linearly accross time.

This project started in December 2022, after a first proof of concept of Substrate pallet [Money Pot](https://github.com/Apolixit/pallet_money_pot) and the [Blazor Front end](https://github.com/Apolixit/moneypot_blazor)
